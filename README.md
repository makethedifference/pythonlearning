# pythonlearning

Python learning repository, also my first Git repository.
Based on Python 3.7, learning from:
1. "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes
2. My curiosity
3. Internet knowledge
4. To be continued


Learning daily for 2 hours (3 if in good mood) in week, 4 in weekends (except weekends reserved for studying).
